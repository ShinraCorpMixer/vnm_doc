## Get started

There are multiple ways to get started using the Visual Novel Machinery plugin.

If you dont want to set up everything yourself, you can download the blank project template [here](#). Don't forget to copy in the plugin into the Plugins folder, as the template comes without the plugin included.
Afterwards you can move on to [creating your first dialog]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link get-started/creating-your-first-dialog.md %}).

If you prefer to set up everything on your own, please continue to the [Project Setup]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link get-started/project-setup/initial-setup.md %}).
