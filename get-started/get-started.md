## Introduction

There are multiple ways to get started using the Visual Novel Machinery plugin.

If you dont want to set up everything yourself, you can download the blank project template here ([C++](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5fj2kn7i71odaqy/VNMBlankProject.zip?dl=0){:target="_blank"}/[BP](https://www.dropbox.com/s/i3yptfgo3xgzz22/VNMBlankProject_BP.zip?dl=0){:target="_blank"}). Don't forget to copy in the plugin into the Plugins folder, as the template comes without the plugin included, if you did not get the plugin from the Unreal Marketplace.
Afterwards you can move on to [creating your first dialog]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link get-started/creating-your-first-dialog.md %}).

If you prefer to set up everything on your own, please continue to the [Project Setup]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link get-started/project-setup/initial-setup.md %}). This will guide your through setting up your own blank project.
