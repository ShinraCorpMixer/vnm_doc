## Get started

There are multiple ways to get started using the Visual Novel Machinery plugin.

If you want to not have to set up everything you can download the blank project template [here](#). Afterwards you can move on to the [Introduction to Dialog Blueprints](/intro/intro-to-dialogs).

If you prefer to set up everything on your own, please continue reading here to set it up.
